## A little note for compiling  
1-  Install curl on MinGW.  
2-  Download [here](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html) SSL certificate for curl and drop near the source code.  
3-  Compile with this code in cmd.  
    ```
      gcc .\dolar-try-converter-online.c -o .\dolar-try-converter-online.exe -lcurl -L C:\MinGW\lib
    ```
